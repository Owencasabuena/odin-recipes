    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Blackout cake is a moist and tender cake with deep cocoa flavor. 
    <br>Layers of chocolate cake are filled with light and airy chocolate pudding, 
    <br>then all of this goodness is enrobed in a rich chocolate ganache. 
    <br>This is a dream dessert: chocolate on chocolate on chocolate.</p>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients.
        </li>

        <li>
            For the cake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). 
            <br>Coat 3 (9-inch) round cake pans with cooking spray; 
            <br>line bottoms of each cake pan with parchment paper, 
            <br>and spray parchment lightly with cooking spray. Set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Whisk together flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, 
            <br>and salt together in a large bowl until no lumps remain.
        </li>

        <li>
            Combine buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. 
            <br>Beat on medium-low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. 
            <br>Reduce speed to low, and gradually beat in flour mixture until just combined, 
            <br>1 to 2 minutes, stopping to scrape down sides of bowl as needed. 
            <br>With mixer on low speed, slowly stream in hot coffee, beating until just incorporated, 
            <br>about 1 minute. Divide batter evenly among the prepared cake pans, about 2 cups each.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, about 18 minutes. 
            <br>Let cakes cool completely in cake pans on a wire rack, about 45 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            While cake cools, prepare filling: Whisk together pudding mix and heavy cream until mostly smooth and slightly thickened, 
            <br>about 2 minutes. Chill, covered, until fully set, about 30 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, prepare frosting: Microwave chocolate chips, butter, 
            <br>and heavy cream in a large microwave-safe bowl on High in 30-second intervals, 
            <br>stirring thoroughly between intervals, until smooth and melted, 
            <br>about 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Chill, covered, 
            <br>until partially set but spreadable, 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            To assemble, remove cooled cakes from cake pans, and discard parchment paper. 
            <br>Slightly trim tops of each cake layer to create a flat surface, 
            <br>and transfer trimmings to a large bowl. Using your hands, 
            <br>break up cake trimmings into fine crumbs, and set them aside 
            <br>(you should have at least 1 1/2 cups crumbs). 
            <br>Place 1 trimmed cake layer, top side up, on a plate or cake stand. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Remove set filling from the refrigerator, and whisk lightly until completely smooth and slightly loosened. 
            <br>Top cake layer with half (about 1 1/2 cups) of filling; spread to edges of cake in an even layer using an 
            <br>offset spatula. Top with second cake layer, top side down, and repeat the process with remaining filling. 
            <br>Top with third cake layer, top side down. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Stir chilled frosting until smooth. Using a large offset spatula, spread frosting evenly over the top and sides of the cake.
        </li>

        <li>
            Gently press reserved cake crumbs evenly over into frosting, covering the top and sides completely. 
            <br>Discard any remaining crumbs. Slice and serve!
        </li>
    </ol>
