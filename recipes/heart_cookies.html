    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I used a no-fail sugar cookie recipe to make these wonderful 
        <br>heart-shaped cookies filled with strawberry jam. I know you will enjoy this recipe.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) jar strawberry jam</li>
        <li>¼ cup powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Cream sugar and butter with an electric mixer until fluffy, about 5 minutes. 
            <br>Mix in egg and vanilla extract. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt together in a separate bowl 
            <br>and add to butter mixture. Mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put a handful of the dough between two sheets of parchment paper and 
            <br>roll to desired thickness. Repeat with the rest of the dough. Put the rolled dough, 
            <br>including the parchment paper, on a cookie sheet and refrigerate for 10 minutes or longer. 
            <br>Repeat the process with scraps after cutting cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut 24 heart-shaped cookies of the same size from the dough. 
            <br>Use a smaller heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut a second hole in half of the cookies; 
            <br>this will be the window where the jam will show through. Transfer the cut cookies to a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 8 to 10 minutes. 
            <br>Transfer the baking sheet to a wire rack to allow to cool, 20 to 30 minutes. 
            <br>Spread about 1/2 teaspoon of jam into the centers of the cookies without the heart-cut centers. 
            <br>Sprinkle powdered sugar on the rest of the cookies with the heart-cut centers, and mount onto the cookies with jam.
        </li>
    </ol>
