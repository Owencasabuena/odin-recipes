    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This mud pie recipe is a dynamite version of a favorite dessert made by

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) chocolate sandwich cookie crumb crust (such as an OREO® crust)</li>
        <li>1 quart coffee ice cream, divided</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package miniature chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge topping</li>
        <li>½ (18 ounce) package crushed chocolate sandwich cookies, divided</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>¾ cup chocolate syrup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Freeze crust until firm, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, place 1/2 of the coffee ice cream into a bowl, and let it soften, about 10 minutes. 
            <br>Return remaining ice cream to the freezer. Mix softened ice cream with mini chocolate chips. 
            <br>Spread mixture in an even layer over the frozen crust. Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat fudge topping in the microwave on low until just warm and easy to pour, about 30 seconds. 
            <br>Pour into a bowl. Set aside 2 tablespoons cookie crumbs for garnish; stir remaining cookie crumbs into fudge topping.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove pie from the freezer and layer fudge mixture over ice cream layer. 
            <br>Cover with plastic wrap, and return to the freezer for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take remaining frozen coffee ice cream out of the freezer, and allow to soften, about 10 minutes. 
            <br>Spread ice cream over fudge layer. Cover with plastic wrap, and return to the freezer for 2 more hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove pie, and spread whipped topping over top. Sprinkle with reserved cookie crumbs to garnish. 
            <br>Cover with plastic wrap and freeze for 2 more hours, or for best results, 8 hours to overnight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the pie into serving pieces and drizzle each serving with about 1 tablespoon chocolate syrup.
        </li>
    </ol>
